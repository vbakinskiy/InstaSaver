A. AGREEMENT:

A. This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you and Publisher ("we", "us" or "our") which governs your use of the Publisher's Apps. By installing or otherwise using the Publisher's Apps, you: (a) agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this EULA, (b) you represent and warrant that you own or control the mobile device in which the Publisher's App will be installed, and (c) you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into this EULA and to abide by all its terms and conditions, just as if you had signed it. The terms and conditions of this EULA also apply to any Publisher's App updates, supplements, and services that are not provided under a separate license or other agreement with us. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this EULA, do not install or use any Publisher's App. We may amend these terms and conditions from time to time. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you of the changes by reasonable means. You acknowledge that an in-app message which notifies you of such changes when you open up the Publisher's App shall constitute reasonable means. Your continued use of the Publisher's Apps after we post any amendments to this EULA will signify your acceptance of such amendments. If you do not agree with any amendment, you must discontinue using the Publisher's Apps. Do not use the Publisher's Apps until your questions and concerns have been answered in this document to your satisfaction and you agree to abide by the EULA.
Notice to consumers: Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction where you live, you may have certain rights that cannot be waived through this EULA and that are in addition to the terms of this EULA, and certain provisions of this EULA may be unenforceable as to you. To the extent that any term or condition of this EULA is unenforceable, the remainder of the EULA shall remain in full force and effect.
Use of the Publisher's Apps is subject to our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into this EULA by reference. This EULA also includes any additional payment terms and other requirements set forth on the download or purchase page through which you purchase or download the Publisher's Apps.

B. AGE REQUIREMENT:
You must be 13 years of age or older to install or to use the Publisher's Apps. If you are at least 13 but not yet 18 years of age, please have your parent or legal guardian review this EULA with you, discuss any questions you might have, and install the Publisher's Apps for you.

Neither Publisher, nor any of its Third Party Partners, guarantee the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data displayed by any Publisher's App.

F. THIRD-PARTY PARTNERS:

All services, advertising, feeds and content, including without limitation, all data, links, articles, graphic or video messages and all information, text, software, music, sound, graphics or other materials ("Content") made available or accessible through an Publisher's App, whether publicly available or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the entity or person from whom it originated. You hereby acknowledge and agree that by using an Publisher's App you may be exposed to Content that may be offensive, indecent or objectionable in your community.

We shall not be responsible for any losses incurred in connection with any misuse of any password or ID.
3. Provided Information. If you provide any information in connection with a Registration, you must provide and maintain accurate, complete and current information. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that your information is inaccurate, not current or not complete, we may suspend or terminate your use of the Publisher's App, and pursue any appropriate legal remedies.

1. INTRODUCTION
This Privacy Policy applies when you use any of the Apps of this publisher and should be read together with the End User License Agreement EULA. By using a Publisher's App, you are consenting to our processing of your information in ways set out in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with it, please do not use any Publisher's Apps. In certain cases, for example, if geolocation data is processed by the relevant Publisher's App, the Publisher's App will prompt you to give additional consent. In such case, you can choose not to give consent to us processing data related to your location but you can still use the Publisher's App.
This Privacy Policy may change so you should review it regularly. We will notify you of any material changes in the way we treat your information through the Publisher's Apps you use.

2. DATA WE COLLECT
When you use an Publisher's App, Publisher may collect data, including information which directly or indirectly identifies you. Your information may be kept in an identifiable format, or in an aggregate format which means that you cannot reasonably be identified from it. The information we collect about you includes:
If an Publisher's App offers you the option to register, we will collect the information you provide to us in the registration form. This may include identification data such as your name, email address or other account or registration information.
We will also collect your information when you use Publisher's Apps such as when you post or share material, upload data, request further services or make selections using the Publisher's Apps, if such functionality is available in the Publisher's App.
We will collect information about you when you interact with us such as when you report a problem, contact or communicate with us.
We may collect certain device information and electronic identifiers such as your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system, your mobile operating system details and the name of your mobile carrier. For example, if you use the iOS platform then Advertiser IDs (also known as "IDFAs") may be collected. Other identifiers collected may include IP addresses, OpenUDID, Session ID, ODIn1, iOS Vendor IDs, MAC addresses, IMEI, Android ID for Android platform, and ODIN1 for OS X (together with the IDFAs, the "App Identifiers").
Information about how and when you use the Publisher's App. This includes the amount of times you used the Publisher's App, which parts of it you viewed and other technical data such as country settings and timestamps.
Geolocation data, which is any information which indicates the geographical position of your device and which may include the time the location was recorded.
